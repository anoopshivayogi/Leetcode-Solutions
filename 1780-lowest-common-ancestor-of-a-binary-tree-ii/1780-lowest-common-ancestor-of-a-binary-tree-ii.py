        ans = dfs(root)  # NOTE: Apparently this is very important; You cannot directly return dfs() if <condition>

        return ans if nodes_found else None


        # In the code for finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree, thereâ€™s a subtle reason why directly returning dfs(root) if nodes_found else None does not work as intended.

# The issue lies in the evaluation of nodes_found in return dfs(root) if nodes_found else None. When this line is executed, nodes_found may not yet be True, even if the DFS (depth-first search) function dfs has identified the LCA. This is because dfs only marks nodes_found = True during the recursive exploration when the LCA node is identified. However, nodes_found may still be False at the time dfs(root) finishes, depending on the traversal order and whether the function was able to set nodes_found early in the traversal.
